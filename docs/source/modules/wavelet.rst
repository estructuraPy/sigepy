Overview
--------

The ``wavelet`` module provides functions for time-frequency analysis using wavelets:

* Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) calculation
* Interactive visualization of wavelet spectra
* Time-frequency analysis of non-stationary signals
* Multiple visualization options (3D plots, contour plots, etc.)
